## Recipe
If you want to get started making pizza right away, here is my dough recipe.
Check the rest of the [article below](#intro) for the background information on how the recipe works,
as well as tips and explanation on the individual steps.

If you do not have access to Italian type 00 flour, you can experiment with bread flour 
(or your local equivalent). Fresh yeast can be substituted with instant yeast by reducing weight to 1/3.

## 1 - Introduction
In 2010 the *sociazione Verace Pizza Napoletana* filed an application with the European Union 
to register neapolitan pizza as a *TSG* (traditional specialities guaranteed). 
The pdf, which is available publicly, also includes the full official recipe and process. 
Why then do we find countless articles and YouTube tutorials by home bakers and cooks, teaching different variations of 
the recipe, when we search the internet for neapolitan pizza?

Not only is the traditional technique of shaping the pizza very difficult, the official recipe also calls for a 
wood-fire oven with a baking temperature of 485Â°C (yes, celsius). That results in a baking time of 60 to 90 seconds.
While I am in no position to simplify the traditional technique (you just gotta practice), I present here my workaround
to making delicious pizza in a domestic electric oven.

The article will first discuss the baking process and how temperature effects the end result. We then examine 
the role different ingredients play in the process of dough making. Next we learn about, *Tangzhong*, an asian 
break-making technique which is useful when making dough with high water content. Putting everything together, 
in section 5 we explain the entire pizza making process in detail, before exploring variations in the final section.

## 2 - Heat and Water
During baking, energy is transferred from the oven to the pizza. After a certain amount of energy is transferred to the 
pizza, the dough becomes cooked and the surface browns.  

The amount of energy needed to change a object's temperature depends on the materials heat capacity. 
The rate at which energy is transferred is proportional to the heat resistance of both materials involved, and
their difference in temperature. When baking at a lower temperature we therefore need to bake the pizza for a longer 
amount of time. We can also change the oven material to something with better suited thermal properties. 
Pizza is commonly baked on stone. Steel, however, has a higher heat capacity and a lower heat resistance then stone.
That means it stores more energy at the same temperature, and transmits it to the pizza faster. Luckily, I am not the 
first one to notice that \[1,2,3\] and *baking-steels* are available as a commercial product 
(You can search on google. But really any slab of steel with low heat resistance should do well).   

In addition, we should put the pizza as close to the top of the oven as possible, as the air will be hottest here. 
The baking-steel will heat the pizza from the bottom sufficiently. We can switch the oven to broiler mode to concentrate 
the entire power output of the oven on the top side of the pizza.

While those methods will decrease baking time considerably, we will not be able to reach the 60 to 90 seconds required
by the original recipe. Longer baking means more time for water to evaporate, and the pizza to dry out. To counteract
that, we will add more water to our dough. High hydration dough can be sticky and takes some practice to work with.
Techniques from bread-making are helpful here, as they often deal with high hydration dough. 
Add as much water as you dare, without loosing control of your dough. Start with a conservative hydration like 60% 
and work your way up as you practice.

The goal is for the underside to NOT dry out and become crispy by the time dark spots appear on the top.
